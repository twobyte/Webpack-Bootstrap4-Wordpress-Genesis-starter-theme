# Privacy Requests

## Genesis user data
Genesis may store personally identifying information about users if they provide data on their user profiles that is personally identifying. This data is stored in the WordPress database with other user profile information that users provide.

Genesis refers to this user profile data as:
- Author Archive Settings
- Author Archive SEO Settings

These settings can be found on the user profile edit screen in the WordPress admin.

If a user does not provide personally identifying data, Genesis does not store anything that is personally identifying about that user.

Additionally, Genesis offers the option to email someone when a new version of Genesis is available. This is an option in the theme settings page under Genesis > Theme Settings. 

## WordPress privacy tools
WordPress currently offers two privacy-related tools for users. Those are:
- Export Personal Data: allows users to export their personal data
- Erase Personal Data: allows users to erase their personal data

When someone uses these tools, Genesis will inform WordPress of the data mentioned above so that WordPress can include it when processing the privacy-related request.
